# Dissecting Spotify Valence

This repository serves as a basic demonstration of data analysis and machine learning for the needs of the Software Eningineering in Practice course offered by the [Department of Management Science & Technology](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/el/dmst) of the Athens University of Economics and Business, supervised by Mr. Panos Louridas.

Spotify uses a metric called *valence* to measure the happiness of a track. Interestingly, we don't know exactly how valence is calculated. In this assignment I dissected Spotify's Valence metric, getting more familiar with many machine learning models, as well as neural networks.
